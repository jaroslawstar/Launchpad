# Launchpad
App that mimics launchpad work, as the original app is no longer available on MacoS 26 Tahoe

There are no groups, folders and other stuff (YET) as it took me 2h and maxing out my ChatGPT lol.
The Liquid Glass effect hopefully is going to be available some time after Apple makes it usable in Objective C++ and AppKit

Closes on event of chosing an app or ESC key.
